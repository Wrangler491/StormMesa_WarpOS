# StormMesa_WarpOS by Wrangler

An implementation of StormMesa 2010 to WarpOS on the PPC

Also includes adapted versions of glu and glut from Niels Froehling's implementation of Mesa 3.1

To make, use the Makeall script

Lockmodes now working - change the lockmode in Amiga_settings.c, although StormMesa.LOCKMODE3.ON=TRUE is probably the best choice

Gears-minigl in the demos directory is the gears demo from WarpUp but compiled with StormMesa
